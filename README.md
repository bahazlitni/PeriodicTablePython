# PeriodicTablePython
Periodic Table Algorithm
You will find multiple functions in 'atomistic.py' (or 'atomistic.js') file that calculate, with a carefully crafted polynomial sequence, various properties of a given atom with its atomic number (Z). Based on the sequence that the current periodic table follows, these functions theoretically extend the periodic table to infinity.
* Careful: Don't put very big numbers in 'getLayers' function since it will generate a very long string of layers and might crash your computer!
* There is no console test app in the javascript version.
